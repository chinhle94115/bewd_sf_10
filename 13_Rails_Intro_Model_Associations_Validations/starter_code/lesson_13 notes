resource - a set of model view controller

associations connect databases, urls, users, etc.
- the primary key is the field that uniquely identifies each row of a table.
  - in rails, this is always the ':id'
- the foreign key identifies which row of another table it is associated with ':user_id'
  - like in SQL; it's what connects two databases
  - ie, the key that identifies this guy in database A is the same guy in database B
associations: 6 types
- belongs_to
    when there is a belongs_to, the foreign key should be in the belongs to
    it associates it to the one it belongs to
- has_many
- has_one
- has_and_belongs_to_many
- has_many :through
- has_one :through


class User < ActiveRecord::Base
